In the fortune cookie - or wisdom cookie - we advance a little further in JavaScript and now have random phrases displayed when clicking on the cookie or pressing Enter on the keyboard (which also happened in the Guessing Game). In addition to the animation applied to the cookie, if you look closely you will see a discreetly dynamic background! As is the law, the application works on desktop and mobile.
